This project is from [The odin project HTML and CSS course](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/html-and-css/lessons/positioning-and-floating-elements). <br>
The goal is to recreate an articule from The New York Times newspaper. I have use this [article](https://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/18/science/space/detection-of-waves-in-space-buttresses-landmark-theory-of-big-bang.html?_r=0) as example.<br>
The main goal is to recreate the layout of the page and style. Links and buttons don't work. It' needs media queries to support smaller screens.
